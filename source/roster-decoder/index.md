__Roster Decoder is a simple viewer for JMRI Rosters that are on Dropbox.__

## Always have your [JMRI](http://jmri.org) rosters with you.

Do you run your trains at a model railroad show or a layout you are visiting? Have you found that, even if they use [JMRI](http://jmri.org) for throttles, you aren't sure what address your locomotives have?

Roster Decoder keeps a copy of your JMRI rosters stored in [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod. You can always have a complete roster with you for reference.
