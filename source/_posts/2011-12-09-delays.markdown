I recently returned from a deployment in Afghanistan, and simply readjusting to life back in the United States has been time consuming...

In any event, the [JMRI Browser](http://www.axsw.co/jmri/browser) and [JMRI Framework](http://www.axsw.co/jmri/framework) projects are both delayed through January and possibly into February.

There's also an update to [Doing Time](http://www.axsw.co/doing-time "Doing Time") in the works with some new features and other internal improvements. I hope to be getting that out in January as well.
