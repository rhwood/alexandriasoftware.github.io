I'm a developer with the *[JMRI](http://jmri.org "The JMRI Project")* project, only since earlier this year, and am really looking forward to the next production release, which will be the second to include code I contributed. I am excited about:

* Changes to XMLIO protocol, which make writing networked iOS and OS X clients for JMRI significantly easier.
* DecoderPro&reg; 3, which introduces sane decoder management.

Alexandria Software will be releasing *[JMRI Browser](http://www.axsw.co/jmri/browser "An iPhone client for JMRI")* and *[JMRI Framework](http://www.axsw.co/jmri/framework "An Objective-C framework for JMRI")* around the next JMRI release.

Incidentally the [Java](http://www.java.com) programming language (required by JMRI) is a surprisingly easy language to use, although I tend to attempt to use Objective-C messaging when hacking at JMRI.
