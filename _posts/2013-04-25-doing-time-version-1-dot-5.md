[Doing Time](/doing-time) version 1.5 is now [available on the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/doing-time/id416919186?mt=8&ls=1).

This update includes the following changes:

-   __Events by duration__ _Doing Time_ can now create an event knowing either the start date and end date, or the start date and the duration (kind of like how many soldiers get their orders).
-   __OPSEC__ It is possible to hide everything but an event's name and the pie chart itself.
-   __Settings per event__ All settings are now per-event, so if you want to hide one event's end date, but not another's, it easy to do.
-   __Count today__ In previous versions of _Doing Time_, we tried to be smart about handling today, and we failed; now you control it.
-   __Accessibility__ VoiceOver works.
-   __iPhone 5 Ready__ The pie chart is larger on iPhone 5 and the iPod Touch (5th Generation) devices, and the letter boxing is gone.
-   __Bugs squashed__ The calculations for the number of days remaining in an event should be more reliable; other bugs though out the application have been dealt with.
