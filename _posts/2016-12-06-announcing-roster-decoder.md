_[Roster Decoder](/roster-decoder)_, my latest app, is a simple viewer for the [JMRI](http://jmri.org) DCC decoder roster, provided it is stored on [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com).

While I was at a toy train show, I realized I needed a list of decoder addresses for my DCC-equipped rolling stock, since the DCC system on the layout I was using was not connected to JMRI and created this app because reading the roster files in the Dropbox app was difficult at best.

As JMRI stores its rosters as XML files and has no issues storing these files in Dropbox, I wrote this to leverage the near continuous availability of Dropbox so I could browse a roster on my iPhone to ensure I properly configured my throttles.
