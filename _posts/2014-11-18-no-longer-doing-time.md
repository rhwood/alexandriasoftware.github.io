I have come to the conclusion that I can either continue to maintain and support _[Doing Time](/doing-time)_ or I can continue to contribute to and support _[JMRI](http://jmri.org)_, an unrelated project I began supporting at about the same time as I initially wrote _Doing Time_. I have neither the time nor energy to work on both _Doing Time_ and _JMRI_. Since I am significantly more emotionally and intellectually involved with _JMRI_ than I am with _Doing Time_, I am ceasing to support _Doing Time_.

I recommend [_T-Zero Countdown Timer_ by Dan Wensor](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/t-zero-countdown-timer/id480487790?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l7iC) as a replacement for _Doing Time_.

What does this mean for _Doing Time_?

-   _Doing Time_ will remain on the App Store through the end of 2014, and will be removed sometime in January 2015.
-   The source code for _Doing Time_ is now [publicly available](https://github.com/rhwood/Doing-Time) on [GitHub](https://github.com) under the MIT license.
-   _Doing Time_ support queries will no longer be answered.
