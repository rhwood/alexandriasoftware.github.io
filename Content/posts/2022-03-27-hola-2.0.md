I am pleased to announce _[Hola](/hola)_ 2.0 is now [available on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hola-browser/id1286639027?ls=1).

Version 2.0 has the following new features:

-   Redesigned and rewritten for iOS 15.
-   Bugs zapped.

_Hola_ finds and displays all web sites on your Wi-Fi network, displaying them in-app or in Safari. _Hola_ is a web browser for sites in a local Wi-Fi network advertised via the Bonjour[^1] (also called Zeroconf) protocol.

Respecting your privacy, _Hola_ does not collect any information and is ad-free.
