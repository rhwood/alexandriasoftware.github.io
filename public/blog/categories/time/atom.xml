    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/doing-time">Doing Time</a> version 1.4 is now <a href="http://axsw.co/gdZJa6">available on the App Store</a>.</p>

<p>This update includes the following changes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A new application icon.</strong> <img class="right no-border" src="/images/doing-time-app-icon.png"> In this release, I simplified a number of things under the hood, as well as some preferences, and so I made the application icon cleaner to reflect this as well.</li>
<li><strong>Simpler preferences.</strong> <em>Doing Time</em> is a daily counter. I had a complex preference item that allowed the user to set the time (down to five minute increments) that Today would be considered over in <em>Doing Time</em>. I have replaced that with a per-event setting to treat Today as either a completed day or a remaining day in the event being tracked. This also made the date calculations significantly simpler under the hood.</li>
<li><strong>Aggressively redraw events.</strong> <em>Doing Time</em> now takes additional steps to ensure that events are redrawn more frequently, with the added benefit that <em>Doing Time</em> should now be a better-behaving background app and use less memory when another app is in use.</li>
<li><strong>Refactored code.</strong> I rewrote the date calculations mechanism to reduce a lot of complexity, and removed everything that was not being used.</li>
</ul>
